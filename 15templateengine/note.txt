template engine
to make the dynamic pages
npm packages
dynamic pages: comes from database 
static: content sticked to the website
ejs: 
used more in template engine 
npm install ejs

nodejs : dynamic pages less
we made more api's in nodejs
but also we will learn about 

// we need to tell the nodejs that we are using the ejs 
app.set( 'viewengine','ejs' )
//we need to create views folder that is the compulsory thing

app.get('/profile',(_,resp)=>{
    resp.render(profile)
})
now we need to render the ejs thing

    <!-- <%= include('common/header.ejs'); %> -->
= shows the html engine / html code not the content 
as the =  refers to showing the content the file actually contains or the object contains 
to show the content with the html code specified in the page 
we need to do - which is hyphen
    <!-- <%- include('common/header.ejs'); %> -->

the purpose of this is to add the html inside the ejs file 
in simple language: header.ejs contains the html code 
and login.ejs and the profile.ejs contains the html code 
but the <%= is where the dynamic data is communicated btn the servers
but in this case the ejs ma external html connection ko lagi 
what we should do vanera thahavayo 
header.ejs ma k xa ??
<nav>
    <h3>header file</h3>
</nav>

aba yesma kei pani xaina <html> closing kei pani but still 
.ejs jun chai main ma run garnu parne ho tesma xa 
yesle html ko same code lai reusable banayo
