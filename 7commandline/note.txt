process contains all the node modules information with the command line
and here we will use the filelink and the fileunlink to add and delete the string 
with respect to the array we will be passing 

arg vector ::
first 0 
first 1 are packed with the dir name which contains the package code to store the array 
2 
3
4 .. unlimited 
we can specify the type of the string with the condition for the another string 
but the kind of function we need to analayze
as filelink commnad will require the array 3 and array4 to be together as 
the array 3 will be the dir name and the array 4 will the string 

thus for condition we can  use the array 2 or array after the 4
