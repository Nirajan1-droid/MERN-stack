CRUD operation in mongodb
mongodb and mongodbcompass


CRUD operation revision 

db.products.deleteMany/deleteOne({brand:"containing"})
brand:object
product:collection

we can also connect two or more than database and their collection
    let db = result.db(database);
vs     let db = result.db('database');=>> this is wrong as this won't show you the database
it wasted about half hour of time 


for post method from the url(which is the req)
    let result = data.insert(req.body)//to insert the data which comes from the body of the url/req
  
  
    // console.log(req.body)//body is the property
yesko kaam req.body lai console ma print garr matra theory
