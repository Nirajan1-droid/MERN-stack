middle ware
req, res are modifiable
authentication check 
wheather the user is logged in or not

we need to change the req and resp
we can change that in routes but why still middle 

because middleware can be made once and used 
but the route needs more code and we cannot reuse install


const reqFilter = (req, res,next)=>{
    //if next function is not executed here then it will not go forward
    //req and resp is same but requires next function to move futher into another function

    console.log('reqFilter')
    next();
}
app.use(reqFilter)


for data placement
right now we are not using the placeholder to place the data 
we are using the query method for placing the data in the direct url place
with this :
http://localhost:5000/users?age=19

and for the age thing we are checking the age by the if elseif and else condition
const reqFilter = (req, res,next)=>{
    //if next function is not executed here then it will not go forward
    //req and resp is same but requires next function to move futher into another function
    if(!req.query.age)
    {
        res.send('Please provide age')
    }
    else if(req.query.age <18){
        res.send('you cannot access this page')
    }
    else{

        next();
    }
}

middleware types:

application -level
router level
if we are doing the middleware for the 50 routes then we do it in routerlevel
error handeling middleware
builtin middleware
third party middleware

//another file bata acess garda hamile 
const lai hataera 
module.exports= functionname = (req,res,next )=>{

}


module.exports= reqFilter = (req, res,next)=>{
    //if next function is not executed here then it will not go forward
    //req and resp is same but requires next function to move futher into another function
    if(!req.query.age)
    {
        res.send('Please provide age')
    }
    else if(req.query.age <18){
        res.send('you cannot access this page')
    }
    else{

        next();
    }
}



for large scale website large middleware

const reqFilter = require('./middleware.js')
const route = express.Router()
route.use(reqFilter)
route.get()//strike in middleware
app.get()//direct next()

app.use('/', route) //yo sab vanda tala vayena vane app.get pani route.get jasari kaam garxa , but this is for the large scale website
